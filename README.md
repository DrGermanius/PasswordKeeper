# PasswordKeeper

App for generation and safe password storing

Used my self-written [algorithm](https://github.com/DrGermanius/PasswordKeeper/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/passwordkeeper/services/PasswordService.java) for password creation

# Features: 
* Creating an account with the following fields: login, pass, description
* Generating a strong password
* Editing and deleting accounts


# Data security was provided by:
* SQLCipher for data encryption 
* Forbiddance of screenshots and screen-recording
* Biomertic authentication (fingerprint if supported by hardware)
